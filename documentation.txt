=> Started the process by looking into https://github.com/phaserjs/template-react

=> Choose this as the base project to start with.

=> Searched for flappy bird game repo with phaserjs

=> Found a lot of examples.

=> Studied one repo with well structured code https://github.com/raychenfj/phaser-flappy-bird and the PhaserJS starter
    guide

=> Found out most of the examples are not using PhaserJS v3

=> Searched for Flappy bird with Phaser v3

=> Found one basic example here-
    https://www.emanueleferonato.com/2019/05/02/flappy-bird-html5-prototype-updated-to-phaser-3-16-2/

=> Added the flappy bird game to the boilerplate game.

=> figured out way to dynamically add resouces


## Backend

=> Had experience with openAI's APIs beforehand
   Thus built the backend with some prompt engineering.
   There are two endpoint in the backend:
   
   1. /generate_description
   	uses the user's un-structured environment description as input and generate detailed
   	description for the components of the game (bird, obstacle & background) using gpt-3.5-turbo
   	model
   
     /generate_image
     	using the detailed image description, this endpoint generates an image,
     	resizes the image accoding to the api parameters , removes the background to make image 		transpaent , then returns a publicly accessible image link.
